Have you ever been browsing through social media and seen a post like this one?

If you’ve ever clicked on one of those links, you’ve probably been presented with a series of statements and asked how much you agree with each of them. At the end, you’re given your classification – whether that’s which Hogwarts house you’re in, which Game of Thrones character you most resemble, or even weirder things like which sandwich best represents you.

Many personality quizzes – including the one – are based on a what’s called the five factor model. Personalities are described by giving numbers (positive or negative) in five different categories with the handy acronym “OCEAN:” openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.

As you take the personality quiz and answer questions, the computer updates your scores based on how you answer each question.

Your score in each category begins at zero and is then adjusted in response to your answers. At the end of the quiz, the program reports the fictional character whose scores are most similar to yours.
